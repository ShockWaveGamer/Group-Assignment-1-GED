This code was not made by us. All it does is allow us to 
display tags as a drop down selection instead of a string 
in the inspector. The code we used is from;
https://www.brechtos.com/tagselectorattribute/, 
by brechtos and Dylan Engelman

All this does is allow us to select an object tag from a drop down 
instead of using a string. This prevents us from making mistakes 
and typos when reffrenceing tags manualy from the inspector to save
time.
